            The system supports livestock herd management on a provincial, national or transnational
            livestock scale. The system has been tested and encouraged for use by FAO - the United
            Nations, the General Statistics Office, and the Department of Livestock Production -
            Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. The system can issue a "Livestock
            Passport" with a unique QR - code to each livestock farming household, issue a
            "Transportation Visa" with a QR code for each shipment, control transportation, total
            herds and disease information. within the province, across regions, and across the
            country. The system can accurately indicate the total herd of livestock (pigs, cattle,
            goats, sheep, chickens, ducks, geese, etc.), the number of dead livestock (causes,
            images) for the veterinary force to confirm. Instant diagnosis and quick emergency
            assistance. Livestock industry leaders in the province and the whole country can grasp
            the exact numbers and situation of livestock herds anytime, anywhere to make timely
            decisions.
